Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification

Overview

In this project, we focus on developing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for image classification. Using the Food11 Image Classification Dataset, the goal is to classify images into 11 different food categories. This project aims to familiarize you with the steps required to preprocess data, develop predictive models, evaluate solutions, and document the findings.

Project Goals

- Data Preprocessing: Load and prepare the dataset for analysis.
- Model Development: Develop CNN models to classify images into 11 food categories.
- Evaluation and Reporting: Evaluate the performance of the models and document the results in a structured report.

Dataset

The dataset used is the Food11 Image Classification Dataset, which contains 11,000 images of 11 different types of food. It is a smaller version of the Food-101 dataset and can be used to train a machine learning model for automatic food recognition in mobile applications.
