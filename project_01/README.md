Regression Models for Tabular Data Analysis

Overview

In this project, we focus on developing regression models for data presented in tabular form. The main objectives are to familiarize with the tools and processes for processing and analyzing such data, develop linear regression models, and write related reports.

Project Goals

Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the given dataset to prepare it for analysis.
Model Development: Develop regression models to estimate the average temperature of a city based on measurements taken from over 1000 cities worldwide.
Analysis and Reporting: Analyze the results and document the findings
